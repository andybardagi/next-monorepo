# Project Overview

## Tech Stack

pnpm workspace + Turborepo. Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 in `apps/web`; shared component library `@workspace/ui` (Base UI + cva + Tailwind CSS v4) in `packages/ui`. TypeScript (ESM) everywhere. Lint/format with oxlint/oxfmt.

### This is NOT the Next.js you know
This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Build, Test & Verify

From the repo root:

- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` — oxlint
- `pnpm format` (check) / `pnpm format:fix` — oxfmt
- `pnpm typecheck` — tsc per package via turbo
- `pnpm build` — turbo build (Next.js)
- `pnpm dev` — dev servers

A change is done only when `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` passes. No test runner is configured yet — the first feature needing tests adds Vitest as part of its scope.

## Code Style

See `docs/conventions.md`. Highlights: kebab-case filenames, named exports, Base UI primitives + cva variants + `cn()` for components, Tailwind design-token utilities only (no hard-coded colors), no ESLint/Prettier configs.

## Architecture

See `docs/architecture.md`. Dependency direction: `apps/web` → `packages/ui` → external; packages never import from apps. Cross-package imports only through `@workspace/ui`'s `exports` map.

## Repo Structure

/apps/storybook -> @workspace/storybook, Storybook docs/preview for @workspace/ui components
/packages/ui -> @workspace/ui shared component library
/packages/typescript-config -> shared tsconfig presets
/docs/architecture.md -> architecture and placement rules
/docs/conventions.md -> code conventions
/docs/PRDs -> Contains the PRDs for the project
/feature_list.json -> Contains the list of features to be implemented. The shape of each feature item is:
```json
